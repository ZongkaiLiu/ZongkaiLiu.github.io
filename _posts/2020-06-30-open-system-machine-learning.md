The parameters increase exponentially when we describe a many body system. The attraction of a neural network is that it can potentially approximate the wave function, or density matrix, with a lot less information.

The wavefunction, or density matrix can be represented by RMB with added ancillary layer to describe the environment.

## Training
variational Monte Carlo scheme is used to minimize the cost function which expresses the difference between the neural network and the true quantum state.
